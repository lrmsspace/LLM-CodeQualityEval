/*
 Given a string s, return the maximum length of a substringÂ such that it contains at most two occurrences of each character.
 Example 1:
 Input: s = "bcbbbcba"
 Output: 4
 Explanation:
 The following substring has a length of 4 and contains at most two occurrences of each character: "bcbbbcba".
 Example 2:
 Input: s = "aaaa"
 Output: 2
 Explanation:
 The following substring has a length of 2 and contains at most two occurrences of each character: "aaaa".
 Constraints:
 2 <= s.length <= 100
 s consists only of lowercase English letters.
