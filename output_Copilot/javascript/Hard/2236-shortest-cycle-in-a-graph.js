/**https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-cycle-in-a-graph/ */
//There is a bi-directional graph with n vertices, where each vertex is labeled from 0 to n - 1. The edges in the graph are represented by a given 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] denotes an edge between vertex ui and vertex vi. Every vertex pair is connected by at most one edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself.
//Return the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. If no cycle exists, return -1.
//A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same node, and each edge in the path is used only once.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[3,4],[4,5],[5,6],[6,3]]
//Output: 3
//Explanation: The cycle with the smallest length is : 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0 
//Example 2:
//Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,2]]
//Output: -1
//Explanation: There are no cycles in this graph.
// 
//Constraints:
//	2 <= n <= 1000
//	1 <= edges.length <= 1000
//	edges[i].length == 2
//	0 <= ui, vi < n
//	ui != vi
//	There are no repeated edges.
