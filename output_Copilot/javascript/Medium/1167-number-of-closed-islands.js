/**https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-closed-islands/ */
//Given a 2D grid consists of 0s (land) and 1s (water).  An island is a maximal 4-directionally connected group of 0s and a closed island is an island totally (all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by 1s.
//Return the number of closed islands.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0],[1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]]
//Output: 2
//Explanation: 
//Islands in gray are closed because they are completely surrounded by water (group of 1s).
//Example 2:
//Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,1,0]]
//Output: 1
//Example 3:
//Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
//               [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
//               [1,0,1,1,1,0,1],
//               [1,0,1,0,1,0,1],
//               [1,0,1,1,1,0,1],
//               [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
//               [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]]
//Output: 2
// 
//Constraints:
//	1 <= grid.length, grid[0].length <= 100
//	0 <= grid[i][j] <=1
