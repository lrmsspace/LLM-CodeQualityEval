/*
 You are given two strings s and t, both of which are anagrams of each other, and an integer k.
 Your task is to determine whether it is possible to split the string s into k equal-sized substrings, rearrange the substrings, and concatenate them in any order to create a new string that matches the given string t.
 Return true if this is possible, otherwise, return false.
 An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once.
 A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.
 Example 1:
 Input: s = "abcd", t = "cdab", k = 2
 Output: true
 Explanation:
 Split s into 2 substrings of length 2: ["ab", "cd"].
 Rearranging these substrings as ["cd", "ab"], and then concatenating them results in "cdab", which matches t.
 Example 2:
 Input: s = "aabbcc", t = "bbaacc", k = 3
 Output: true
 Explanation:
 Split s into 3 substrings of length 2: ["aa", "bb", "cc"].
 Rearranging these substrings as ["bb", "aa", "cc"], and then concatenating them results in "bbaacc", which matches t.
 Example 3:
 Input: s = "aabbcc", t = "bbaacc", k = 2
 Output: false
 Explanation:
 Split s into 2 substrings of length 3: ["aab", "bcc"].
 These substrings cannot be rearranged to form t = "bbaacc", so the output is false.
 Constraints:
 1 <= s.length == t.length <= 2 * 105
 1 <= k <= s.length
 s.length is divisible by k.
 s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
 The input is generated such that s and t are anagrams of each other.
