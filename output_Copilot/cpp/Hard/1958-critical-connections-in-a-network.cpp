/**https://leetcode.com/problems/critical-connections-in-a-network/ */
//There are n servers numbered from 0 to n - 1 connected by undirected server-to-server connections forming a network where connections[i] = [ai, bi] represents a connection between servers ai and bi. Any server can reach other servers directly or indirectly through the network.
//A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some servers unable to reach some other server.
//Return all critical connections in the network in any order.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[1,3]]
//Output: [[1,3]]
//Explanation: [[3,1]] is also accepted.
//Example 2:
//Input: n = 2, connections = [[0,1]]
//Output: [[0,1]]
// 
//Constraints:
//	2 <= n <= 105
//	n - 1 <= connections.length <= 105
//	0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1
//	ai != bi
//	There are no repeated connections.
