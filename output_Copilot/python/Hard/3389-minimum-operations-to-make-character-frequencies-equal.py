# You are given a string s.
# A string t is called good if all characters of t occur the same number of times.
# You can perform the following operations any number of times:
# Delete a character from s.
# Insert a character in s.
# Change a character in s to its next letter in the alphabet.
# Note that you cannot change 'z' to 'a' using the third operation.
# Return the minimum number of operations required to make s good.
# Example 1:
# Input: s = "acab"
# Output: 1
# Explanation:
# We can make s good by deleting one occurrence of character 'a'.
# Example 2:
# Input: s = "wddw"
# Output: 0
# Explanation:
# We do not need to perform any operations since s is initially good.
# Example 3:
# Input: s = "aaabc"
# Output: 2
# Explanation:
# We can make s good by applying these operations:
# Change one occurrence of 'a' to 'b'
# Insert one occurrence of 'c' into s
# Constraints:
# 3 <= s.length <= 2Â * 104
# s contains only lowercase English letters.
