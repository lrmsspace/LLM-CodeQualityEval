/**https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-tree-from-leaf-values/ */
//Given an array arr of positive integers, consider all binary trees such that:
//	Each node has either 0 or 2 children;
//	The values of arr correspond to the values of each leaf in an in-order traversal of the tree.
//	The value of each non-leaf node is equal to the product of the largest leaf value in its left and right subtree, respectively.
//Among all possible binary trees considered, return the smallest possible sum of the values of each non-leaf node. It is guaranteed this sum fits into a 32-bit integer.
//A node is a leaf if and only if it has zero children.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: arr = [6,2,4]
//Output: 32
//Explanation: There are two possible trees shown.
//The first has a non-leaf node sum 36, and the second has non-leaf node sum 32.
//Example 2:
//Input: arr = [4,11]
//Output: 44
// 
//Constraints:
//	2 <= arr.length <= 40
//	1 <= arr[i] <= 15
//	It is guaranteed that the answer fits into a 32-bit signed integer (i.e., it is less than 231).
