/**https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator/ */
//Given a string s representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return the result of the evaluation.
//Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: s = "1 + 1"
//Output: 2
//Example 2:
//Input: s = " 2-1 + 2 "
//Output: 3
//Example 3:
//Input: s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
//Output: 23
// 
//Constraints:
//	1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
//	s consists of digits, '+', '-', '(', ')', and ' '.
//	s represents a valid expression.
//	'+' is not used as a unary operation (i.e., "+1" and "+(2 + 3)" is invalid).
//	'-' could be used as a unary operation (i.e., "-1" and "-(2 + 3)" is valid).
//	There will be no two consecutive operators in the input.
//	Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.
