/**https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-area-rectangle-ii/ */
//You are given an array of points in the X-Y plane points where points[i] = [xi, yi].
//Return the minimum area of any rectangle formed from these points, with sides not necessarily parallel to the X and Y axes. If there is not any such rectangle, return 0.
//Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: points = [[1,2],[2,1],[1,0],[0,1]]
//Output: 2.00000
//Explanation: The minimum area rectangle occurs at [1,2],[2,1],[1,0],[0,1], with an area of 2.
//Example 2:
//Input: points = [[0,1],[2,1],[1,1],[1,0],[2,0]]
//Output: 1.00000
//Explanation: The minimum area rectangle occurs at [1,0],[1,1],[2,1],[2,0], with an area of 1.
//Example 3:
//Input: points = [[0,3],[1,2],[3,1],[1,3],[2,1]]
//Output: 0
//Explanation: There is no possible rectangle to form from these points.
// 
//Constraints:
//	1 <= points.length <= 50
//	points[i].length == 2
//	0 <= xi, yi <= 4 * 104
//	All the given points are unique.
