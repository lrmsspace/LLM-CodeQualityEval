/**https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/ */
//You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
//The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.
//Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
//Output: 6
//Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
//Example 2:
//Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
//Output: 0
// 
//Constraints:
//	m == grid.length
//	n == grid[i].length
//	1 <= m, n <= 50
//	grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
