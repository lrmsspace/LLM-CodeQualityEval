# You are given an integer array nums of length n, and a positive integer k.
# The power of a subsequence is defined as the minimum absolute difference between any two elements in the subsequence.
# Return the sum of powers of all subsequences of nums which have length equal to k.
# Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 3
# Output: 4
# Explanation:
# There are 4 subsequences in nums which have length 3: [1,2,3], [1,3,4], [1,2,4], and [2,3,4]. The sum of powers is |2 - 3| + |3 - 4| + |2 - 1| + |3 - 4| = 4.
# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [2,2], k = 2
# Output: 0
# Explanation:
# The only subsequence in nums which has length 2 isÂ [2,2]. The sum of powers is |2 - 2| = 0.
# Example 3:
# Input: nums = [4,3,-1], k = 2
# Output: 10
# Explanation:
# There are 3 subsequences in nums which have length 2: [4,3], [4,-1], and [3,-1]. The sum of powers is |4 - 3| + |4 - (-1)| + |3 - (-1)| = 10.
# Constraints:
# 2 <= n == nums.length <= 50
# -108 <= nums[i] <= 108 
# 2 <= k <= n
