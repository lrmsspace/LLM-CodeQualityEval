/**https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-beautiful-partitions/ */
//You are given a string s that consists of the digits '1' to '9' and two integers k and minLength.
//A partition of s is called beautiful if:
//	s is partitioned into k non-intersecting substrings.
//	Each substring has a length of at least minLength.
//	Each substring starts with a prime digit and ends with a non-prime digit. Prime digits are '2', '3', '5', and '7', and the rest of the digits are non-prime.
//Return the number of beautiful partitions of s. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
//A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: s = "23542185131", k = 3, minLength = 2
//Output: 3
//Explanation: There exists three ways to create a beautiful partition:
//"2354 | 218 | 5131"
//"2354 | 21851 | 31"
//"2354218 | 51 | 31"
//Example 2:
//Input: s = "23542185131", k = 3, minLength = 3
//Output: 1
//Explanation: There exists one way to create a beautiful partition: "2354 | 218 | 5131".
//Example 3:
//Input: s = "3312958", k = 3, minLength = 1
//Output: 1
//Explanation: There exists one way to create a beautiful partition: "331 | 29 | 58".
// 
//Constraints:
//	1 <= k, minLength <= s.length <= 1000
//	s consists of the digits '1' to '9'.
