/**https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/ */
//A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.
//The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.
//Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: root = [1,2,3]
//Output: 6
//Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.
//Example 2:
//Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
//Output: 42
//Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.
// 
//Constraints:
//	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3 * 104].
//	-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
