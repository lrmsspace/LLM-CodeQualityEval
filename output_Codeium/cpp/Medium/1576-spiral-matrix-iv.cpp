/**https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix-iv/ */
//You are given two integers m and n, which represent the dimensions of a matrix.
//You are also given the head of a linked list of integers.
//Generate an m x n matrix that contains the integers in the linked list presented in spiral order (clockwise), starting from the top-left of the matrix. If there are remaining empty spaces, fill them with -1.
//Return the generated matrix.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: m = 3, n = 5, head = [3,0,2,6,8,1,7,9,4,2,5,5,0]
//Output: [[3,0,2,6,8],[5,0,-1,-1,1],[5,2,4,9,7]]
//Explanation: The diagram above shows how the values are printed in the matrix.
//Note that the remaining spaces in the matrix are filled with -1.
//Example 2:
//Input: m = 1, n = 4, head = [0,1,2]
//Output: [[0,1,2,-1]]
//Explanation: The diagram above shows how the values are printed from left to right in the matrix.
//The last space in the matrix is set to -1.
// 
//Constraints:
//	1 <= m, n <= 105
//	1 <= m * n <= 105
//	The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, m * n].
//	0 <= Node.val <= 1000
