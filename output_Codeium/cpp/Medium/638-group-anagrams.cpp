/**https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/ */
//Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
//Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
//Explanation:
//	There is no string in strs that can be rearranged to form "bat".
//	The strings "nat" and "tan" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
//	The strings "ate", "eat", and "tea" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
//Example 2:
//Input: strs = [""]
//Output: [[""]]
//Example 3:
//Input: strs = ["a"]
//Output: [["a"]]
// 
//Constraints:
//	1 <= strs.length <= 104
//	0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
//	strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
