/**https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-from-removing-substrings/ */
//You are given a string s and two integers x and y. You can perform two types of operations any number of times.
//	Remove substring "ab" and gain x points.
//	
//		For example, when removing "ab" from "cabxbae" it becomes "cxbae".
//	
//	
//	Remove substring "ba" and gain y points.
//	
//		For example, when removing "ba" from "cabxbae" it becomes "cabxe".
//	
//	
//Return the maximum points you can gain after applying the above operations on s.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: s = "cdbcbbaaabab", x = 4, y = 5
//Output: 19
//Explanation:
//- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcbbaaabab". Now, s = "cdbcbbaaab" and 5 points are added to the score.
//- Remove the "ab" underlined in "cdbcbbaaab". Now, s = "cdbcbbaa" and 4 points are added to the score.
//- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcbbaa". Now, s = "cdbcba" and 5 points are added to the score.
//- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcba". Now, s = "cdbc" and 5 points are added to the score.
//Total score = 5 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 19.
//Example 2:
//Input: s = "aabbaaxybbaabb", x = 5, y = 4
//Output: 20
// 
//Constraints:
//	1 <= s.length <= 105
//	1 <= x, y <= 104
//	s consists of lowercase English letters.
