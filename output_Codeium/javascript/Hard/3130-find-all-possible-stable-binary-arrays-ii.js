/*
 You are given 3 positive integers zero, one, and limit.
 A binary array arr is called stable if:
 The number of occurrences of 0 in arr is exactly zero.
 The number of occurrences of 1 in arr is exactly one.
 Each subarray of arr with a size greater than limit must contain both 0 and 1.
 Return the total number of stable binary arrays.
 Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 Example 1:
 Input: zero = 1, one = 1, limit = 2
 Output: 2
 Explanation:
 The two possible stable binary arrays are [1,0] and [0,1].
 Example 2:
 Input: zero = 1, one = 2, limit = 1
 Output: 1
 Explanation:
 The only possible stable binary array is [1,0,1].
 Example 3:
 Input: zero = 3, one = 3, limit = 2
 Output: 14
 Explanation:
 All the possible stable binary arrays are [0,0,1,0,1,1], [0,0,1,1,0,1], [0,1,0,0,1,1], [0,1,0,1,0,1], [0,1,0,1,1,0], [0,1,1,0,0,1], [0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,1], [1,0,0,1,1,0], [1,0,1,0,0,1], [1,0,1,0,1,0], [1,0,1,1,0,0], [1,1,0,0,1,0], and [1,1,0,1,0,0].
 Constraints:
 1 <= zero, one, limit <= 1000
