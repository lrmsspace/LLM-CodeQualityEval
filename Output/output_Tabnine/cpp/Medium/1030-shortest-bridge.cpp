/**https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-bridge/ */
//You are given an n x n binary matrix grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.
//An island is a 4-directionally connected group of 1's not connected to any other 1's. There are exactly two islands in grid.
//You may change 0's to 1's to connect the two islands to form one island.
//Return the smallest number of 0's you must flip to connect the two islands.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]
//Output: 1
//Example 2:
//Input: grid = [[0,1,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,1]]
//Output: 2
//Example 3:
//Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1],[1,0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0,1],[1,0,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1]]
//Output: 1
// 
//Constraints:
//	n == grid.length == grid[i].length
//	2 <= n <= 100
//	grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
//	There are exactly two islands in grid.
