# You are given an integer array nums containing positive integers. We define a function encrypt such that encrypt(x) replaces every digit in x with the largest digit in x. For example, encrypt(523) = 555 and encrypt(213) = 333.
# Return the sum of encrypted elements.
# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [1,2,3]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The encrypted elements areÂ [1,2,3]. The sum of encrypted elements is 1 + 2 + 3 == 6.
# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [10,21,31]
# Output: 66
# Explanation: The encrypted elements are [11,22,33]. The sum of encrypted elements is 11 + 22 + 33 == 66.
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 50
# 1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
