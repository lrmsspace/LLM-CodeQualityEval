# You are given two integers,Â n and k.
# An array of distinct positive integers is called a k-avoiding array if there does not exist any pair of distinct elements that sum to k.
# Return the minimum possible sum of a k-avoiding array of length n.
# Example 1:
# Input: n = 5, k = 4
# Output: 18
# Explanation: Consider the k-avoiding array [1,2,4,5,6], which has a sum of 18.
# It can be proven that there is no k-avoiding array with a sum less than 18.
# Example 2:
# Input: n = 2, k = 6
# Output: 3
# Explanation: We can construct the array [1,2], which has a sum of 3.
# It can be proven that there is no k-avoiding array with a sum less than 3.
# Constraints:
# 1 <= n, k <= 50
