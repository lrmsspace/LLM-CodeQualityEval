/**https://leetcode.com/problems/keyboard-row/ */
//Given an array of strings words, return the words that can be typed using letters of the alphabet on only one row of American keyboard like the image below.
//Note that the strings are case-insensitive, both lowercased and uppercased of the same letter are treated as if they are at the same row.
//In the American keyboard:
//	the first row consists of the characters "qwertyuiop",
//	the second row consists of the characters "asdfghjkl", and
//	the third row consists of the characters "zxcvbnm".
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: words = ["Hello","Alaska","Dad","Peace"]
//Output: ["Alaska","Dad"]
//Explanation:
//Both "a" and "A" are in the 2nd row of the American keyboard due to case insensitivity.
//Example 2:
//Input: words = ["omk"]
//Output: []
//Example 3:
//Input: words = ["adsdf","sfd"]
//Output: ["adsdf","sfd"]
// 
//Constraints:
//	1 <= words.length <= 20
//	1 <= words[i].length <= 100
//	words[i] consists of English letters (both lowercase and uppercase).

 * @param {string[]} words
