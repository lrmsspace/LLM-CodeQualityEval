/*
 You are given two integers,Â n and k.
 An array of distinct positive integers is called a k-avoiding array if there does not exist any pair of distinct elements that sum to k.
 Return the minimum possible sum of a k-avoiding array of length n.
 Example 1:
 Input: n = 5, k = 4
 Output: 18
 Explanation: Consider the k-avoiding array [1,2,4,5,6], which has a sum of 18.
 It can be proven that there is no k-avoiding array with a sum less than 18.
 Example 2:
 Input: n = 2, k = 6
 Output: 3
 Explanation: We can construct the array [1,2], which has a sum of 3.
 It can be proven that there is no k-avoiding array with a sum less than 3.
 Constraints:
 1 <= n, k <= 50
