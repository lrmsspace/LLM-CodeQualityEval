/*
 Given a 2D character matrix grid, where grid[i][j] is either 'X', 'Y', or '.', return the number of submatrices that contain:
 grid[0][0]
 an equal frequency of 'X' and 'Y'.
 at least one 'X'.
 Example 1:
 Input: grid = [["X","Y","."],["Y",".","."]]
 Output: 3
 Explanation:
 Example 2:
 Input: grid = [["X","X"],["X","Y"]]
 Output: 0
 Explanation:
 No submatrix has an equal frequency of 'X' and 'Y'.
 Example 3:
 Input: grid = [[".","."],[".","."]]
 Output: 0
 Explanation:
 No submatrix has at least one 'X'.
 Constraints:
 1 <= grid.length, grid[i].length <= 1000
 grid[i][j] is either 'X', 'Y', or '.'.
