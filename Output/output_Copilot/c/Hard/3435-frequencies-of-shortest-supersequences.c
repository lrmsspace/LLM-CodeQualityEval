/*
 You are given an array of strings words. Find all shortest common supersequences (SCS) of words that are not permutations of each other.
 A shortest common supersequence is a string of minimum length that contains each string in words as a subsequence.
 Return a 2D array of integers freqs that represent all the SCSs. Each freqs[i] is an array of size 26, representing the frequency of each letter in the lowercase English alphabet for a single SCS. You may return the frequency arrays in any order.
 Example 1:
 Input: words = ["ab","ba"]
 Output: [[1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
 Explanation:
 The two SCSs are "aba" and "bab". The output is the letter frequencies for each one.
 Example 2:
 Input: words = ["aa","ac"]
 Output: [[2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
 Explanation:
 The two SCSs are "aac" and "aca". Since they are permutations of each other, keep only "aac".
 Example 3:
 Input: words = ["aa","bb","cc"]
 Output: [[2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
 Explanation:
 "aabbcc" and all its permutations are SCSs.
 Constraints:
 1 <= words.length <= 256
 words[i].length == 2
 All strings in words will altogether be composed of no more than 16 unique lowercase letters.
 All strings in words are unique.
