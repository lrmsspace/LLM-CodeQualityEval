/*
 You are given an array maximumHeight, where maximumHeight[i] denotes the maximum height the ith tower can be assigned.
 Your task is to assign a height to each tower so that:
 The height of the ith tower is a positive integer and does not exceed maximumHeight[i].
 No two towers have the same height.
 Return the maximum possible total sum of the tower heights. If it's not possible to assign heights, return -1.
 Example 1:
 Input: maximumHeight = [2,3,4,3]
 Output: 10
 Explanation:
 We can assign heights in the following way: [1, 2, 4, 3].
 Example 2:
 Input: maximumHeight = [15,10]
 Output: 25
 Explanation:
 We can assign heights in the following way: [15, 10].
 Example 3:
 Input: maximumHeight = [2,2,1]
 Output: -1
 Explanation:
 It's impossible to assign positive heights to each index so that no two towers have the same height.
 Constraints:
 1 <= maximumHeight.lengthÂ <= 105
 1 <= maximumHeight[i] <= 109
