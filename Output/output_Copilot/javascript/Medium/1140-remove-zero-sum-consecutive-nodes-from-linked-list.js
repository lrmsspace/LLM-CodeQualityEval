/**https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-zero-sum-consecutive-nodes-from-linked-list/ */
//Given the head of a linked list, we repeatedly delete consecutive sequences of nodes that sum to 0 until there are no such sequences.
//After doing so, return the head of the final linked list.  You may return any such answer.
// 
//(Note that in the examples below, all sequences are serializations of ListNode objects.)
//Example 1:
//Input: head = [1,2,-3,3,1]
//Output: [3,1]
//Note: The answer [1,2,1] would also be accepted.
//Example 2:
//Input: head = [1,2,3,-3,4]
//Output: [1,2,4]
//Example 3:
//Input: head = [1,2,3,-3,-2]
//Output: [1]
// 
//Constraints:
//	The given linked list will contain between 1 and 1000 nodes.
//	Each node in the linked list has -1000 <= node.val <= 1000.
