/*
 You are given an integer n and an undirected, weighted tree rooted at node 0 with n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1. This is represented by a 2D array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi] indicates an edge from node ui to vi with weight wi.
 The weighted median node is defined as the first node x on the path from ui to vi such that the sum of edge weights from ui to x is greater than or equal to half of the total path weight.
 You are given a 2D integer array queries. For each queries[j] = [uj, vj], determine the weighted median node along the path from uj to vj.
 Return an array ans, where ans[j] is the node index of the weighted median for queries[j].
 Example 1:
 Input: n = 2, edges = [[0,1,7]], queries = [[1,0],[0,1]]
 Output: [0,1]

 Constraints:
 2 <= n <= 105
 edges.length == n - 1
 edges[i] == [ui, vi, wi]
 0 <= ui, vi < n
 1 <= wi <= 109
 1 <= queries.length <= 105
 queries[j] == [uj, vj]
 0 <= uj, vj < n
 The input is generated such that edges represents a valid tree.
