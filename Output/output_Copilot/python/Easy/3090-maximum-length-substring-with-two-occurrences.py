# Given a string s, return the maximum length of a substringÂ such that it contains at most two occurrences of each character.
# Example 1:
# Input: s = "bcbbbcba"
# Output: 4
# Explanation:
# The following substring has a length of 4 and contains at most two occurrences of each character: "bcbbbcba".
# Example 2:
# Input: s = "aaaa"
# Output: 2
# Explanation:
# The following substring has a length of 2 and contains at most two occurrences of each character: "aaaa".
# Constraints:
# 2 <= s.length <= 100
# s consists only of lowercase English letters.
