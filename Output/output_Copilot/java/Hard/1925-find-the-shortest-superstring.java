/**https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-shortest-superstring/ */
//Given an array of strings words, return the smallest string that contains each string in words as a substring. If there are multiple valid strings of the smallest length, return any of them.
//You may assume that no string in words is a substring of another string in words.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: words = ["alex","loves","leetcode"]
//Output: "alexlovesleetcode"
//Explanation: All permutations of "alex","loves","leetcode" would also be accepted.
//Example 2:
//Input: words = ["catg","ctaagt","gcta","ttca","atgcatc"]
//Output: "gctaagttcatgcatc"
// 
//Constraints:
//	1 <= words.length <= 12
//	1 <= words[i].length <= 20
//	words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
//	All the strings of words are unique.
