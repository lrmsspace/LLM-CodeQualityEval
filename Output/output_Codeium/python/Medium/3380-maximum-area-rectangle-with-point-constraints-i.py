# You are given an array points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents the coordinates of a point on an infinite plane.
# Your task is to find the maximum area of a rectangle that:
# Can be formed using four of these points as its corners.
# Does not contain any other point inside or on its border.
# Has its edgesÂ parallel to the axes.
# Return the maximum area that you can obtain or -1 if no such rectangle is possible.
# Example 1:
# Input: points = [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3]]
# Output: 4
# Explanation:
# We can make a rectangle with these 4 points as corners and there is no other point that lies inside or on the border. Hence, the maximum possible area would be 4.
# Example 2:
# Input: points = [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3],[2,2]]
# Output: -1
# Explanation:
# There is only one rectangle possible is with points [1,1], [1,3], [3,1] and [3,3] but [2,2] will always lie inside it. Hence, returning -1.
# Example 3:
# Input: points = [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3],[1,2],[3,2]]
# Output: 2
# Explanation:
# The maximum area rectangle is formed by the points [1,3], [1,2], [3,2], [3,3], which has an area of 2. Additionally, the points [1,1], [1,2], [3,1], [3,2] also form a valid rectangle with the same area.
# Constraints:
# 1 <= points.length <= 10
# points[i].length == 2
# 0 <= xi, yi <= 100
# All the given points are unique.
