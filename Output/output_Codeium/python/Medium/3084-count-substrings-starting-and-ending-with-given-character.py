# You are given a string s and a character c. Return the total number of substrings of s that start and end with c.
# Example 1:
# Input: s = "abada", c = "a"
# Output: 6
# Explanation: Substrings starting and ending with "a" are: "abada", "abada", "abada", "abada", "abada", "abada".
# Example 2:
# Input: s = "zzz", c = "z"
# Output: 6
# Explanation: There are a total of 6 substrings in s and all start and end with "z".
# Constraints:
# 1 <= s.length <= 105
# s and c consistÂ only of lowercase English letters.
