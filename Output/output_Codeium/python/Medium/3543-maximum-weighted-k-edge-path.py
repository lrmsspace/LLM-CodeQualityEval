# You are given an integer n and a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. This is represented by a 2D array edges, where edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi] indicates a directed edge from node ui to vi with weight wi.
# You are also given two integers, k and t.
# Your task is to determine the maximum possible sum of edge weights for any path in the graph such that:
# The path contains exactly k edges.
# The total sum of edge weights in the path is strictly less than t.
# Return the maximum possible sum of weights for such a path. If no such path exists, return -1.
# Example 1:
# Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,2]], k = 2, t = 4
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# The only path with k = 2 edges is 0 -> 1 -> 2 with weight 1 + 2 = 3 < t.
# Thus, the maximum possible sum of weights less than t is 3.
# Example 2:
# Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,2],[0,2,3]], k = 1, t = 3
# Output: 2
# Explanation:
# There are two paths with k = 1 edge:
# 0 -> 1 with weight 2 < t.
# 0 -> 2 with weight 3 = t, which is not strictly less than t.
# Thus, the maximum possible sum of weights less than t is 2.
# Example 3:
# Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,6],[1,2,8]], k = 1, t = 6
# Output: -1
# Explanation:
# There are two paths with k = 1 edge:
# 0 -> 1 with weight 6 = t, which is not strictly less than t.
# 1 -> 2 with weight 8 > t, which is not strictly less than t.
# Since there is no path with sum of weights strictly less than t, the answer is -1.
# Constraints:
# 1 <= n <= 300
# 0 <= edges.length <= 300
# edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi]
# 0 <= ui, vi < n
# ui != vi
# 1 <= wi <= 10
# 0 <= k <= 300
# 1 <= t <= 600
# The input graph is guaranteed to be a DAG.
# There are no duplicate edges.
