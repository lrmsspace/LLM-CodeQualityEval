/*
 You are given an integer array nums.
 You can do the following operation on the array at most once:
 Choose any integer x such that nums remains non-empty on removing all occurrences of x.
 RemoveÂ all occurrences of x from the array.
 Return the maximum subarray sum across all possible resulting arrays.
 Example 1:
 Input: nums = [-3,2,-2,-1,3,-2,3]
 Output: 7
 Explanation:
 We can have the following arrays after at most one operation:
 The original array is nums = [-3, 2, -2, -1, 3, -2, 3]. The maximum subarray sum is 3 + (-2) + 3 = 4.
 Deleting all occurences of x = -3 results in nums = [2, -2, -1, 3, -2, 3]. The maximum subarray sum is 3 + (-2) + 3 = 4.
 Deleting all occurences of x = -2 results in nums = [-3, 2, -1, 3, 3]. The maximum subarray sum is 2 + (-1) + 3 + 3 = 7.
 Deleting all occurences of x = -1 results in nums = [-3, 2, -2, 3, -2, 3]. The maximum subarray sum is 3 + (-2) + 3 = 4.
 Deleting all occurences of x = 3 results in nums = [-3, 2, -2, -1, -2]. The maximum subarray sum is 2.
 The output is max(4, 4, 7, 4, 2) = 7.
 Example 2:
 Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
 Output: 10
 Explanation:
 It is optimal to not perform any operations.
 Constraints:
 1 <= nums.length <= 105
 -106 <= nums[i] <= 106
