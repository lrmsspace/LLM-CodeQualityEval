/**https://leetcode.com/problems/dungeon-game/ */
//The demons had captured the princess and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of m x n rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through dungeon to rescue the princess.
//The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.
//Some of the rooms are guarded by demons (represented by negative integers), so the knight loses health upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (represented as 0) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (represented by positive integers).
//To reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.
//Return the knight's minimum initial health so that he can rescue the princess.
//Note that any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: dungeon = [[-2,-3,3],[-5,-10,1],[10,30,-5]]
//Output: 7
//Explanation: The initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path: RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN.
//Example 2:
//Input: dungeon = [[0]]
//Output: 1
// 
//Constraints:
//	m == dungeon.length
//	n == dungeon[i].length
//	1 <= m, n <= 200
//	-1000 <= dungeon[i][j] <= 1000
