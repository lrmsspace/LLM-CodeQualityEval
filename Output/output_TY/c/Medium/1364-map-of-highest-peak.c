/**https://leetcode.com/problems/map-of-highest-peak/ */
//You are given an integer matrix isWater of size m x n that represents a map of land and water cells.
//	If isWater[i][j] == 0, cell (i, j) is a land cell.
//	If isWater[i][j] == 1, cell (i, j) is a water cell.
//You must assign each cell a height in a way that follows these rules:
//	The height of each cell must be non-negative.
//	If the cell is a water cell, its height must be 0.
//	Any two adjacent cells must have an absolute height difference of at most 1. A cell is adjacent to another cell if the former is directly north, east, south, or west of the latter (i.e., their sides are touching).
//Find an assignment of heights such that the maximum height in the matrix is maximized.
//Return an integer matrix height of size m x n where height[i][j] is cell (i, j)'s height. If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: isWater = [[0,1],[0,0]]
//Output: [[1,0],[2,1]]
//Explanation: The image shows the assigned heights of each cell.
//The blue cell is the water cell, and the green cells are the land cells.
//Example 2:
//Input: isWater = [[0,0,1],[1,0,0],[0,0,0]]
//Output: [[1,1,0],[0,1,1],[1,2,2]]
//Explanation: A height of 2 is the maximum possible height of any assignment.
//Any height assignment that has a maximum height of 2 while still meeting the rules will also be accepted.
// 
//Constraints:
//	m == isWater.length
//	n == isWater[i].length
//	1 <= m, n <= 1000
//	isWater[i][j] is 0 or 1.
//	There is at least one water cell.
