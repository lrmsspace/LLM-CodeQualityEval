/*
 You are given the root of a binary tree and an integer k.
 Return an integer denoting the size of the kth largest perfect binary subtree, or -1 if it doesn't exist.
 A perfect binary tree is a tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children.
 Example 1:
 Input: root = [5,3,6,5,2,5,7,1,8,null,null,6,8], k = 2
 Output: 3
 Explanation:
 The roots of the perfect binary subtrees are highlighted in black. Their sizes, in non-increasing order are [3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].
 The 2nd largest size is 3.
 Example 2:
 Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 1
 Output: 7
 Explanation:
 The sizes of the perfect binary subtrees in non-increasing order are [7, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1]. The size of the largest perfect binary subtree is 7.
 Example 3:
 Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4], k = 3
 Output: -1
 Explanation:
 The sizes of the perfect binary subtrees in non-increasing order are [1, 1]. There are fewer than 3 perfect binary subtrees.
 Constraints:
 The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 2000].
 1 <= Node.val <= 2000
 1 <= k <= 1024
