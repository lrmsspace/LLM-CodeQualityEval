/**https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder-ii/ */
//A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:
//	Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
//	Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
//	sk == endWord
//Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return all the shortest transformation sequences from beginWord to endWord, or an empty list if no such sequence exists. Each sequence should be returned as a list of the words [beginWord, s1, s2, ..., sk].
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
//Output: [["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]]
//Explanation: There are 2 shortest transformation sequences:
//"hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog"
//"hit" -> "hot" -> "lot" -> "log" -> "cog"
//Example 2:
//Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
//Output: []
//Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
// 
//Constraints:
//	1 <= beginWord.length <= 5
//	endWord.length == beginWord.length
//	1 <= wordList.length <= 500
//	wordList[i].length == beginWord.length
//	beginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
//	beginWord != endWord
//	All the words in wordList are unique.
//	The sum of all shortest transformation sequences does not exceed 105.
