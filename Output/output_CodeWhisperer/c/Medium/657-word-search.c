/**https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/ */
//Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the grid.
//The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED"
//Output: true
//Example 2:
//Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "SEE"
//Output: true
//Example 3:
//Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCB"
//Output: false
// 
//Constraints:
//	m == board.length
//	n = board[i].length
//	1 <= m, n <= 6
//	1 <= word.length <= 15
//	board and word consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.
//
