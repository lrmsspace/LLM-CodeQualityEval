/**https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-bounded-in-circle/ */
//On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at (0, 0) and faces north. Note that:
//	The north direction is the positive direction of the y-axis.
//	The south direction is the negative direction of the y-axis.
//	The east direction is the positive direction of the x-axis.
//	The west direction is the negative direction of the x-axis.
//The robot can receive one of three instructions:
//	"G": go straight 1 unit.
//	"L": turn 90 degrees to the left (i.e., anti-clockwise direction).
//	"R": turn 90 degrees to the right (i.e., clockwise direction).
//The robot performs the instructions given in order, and repeats them forever.
//Return true if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: instructions = "GGLLGG"
//Output: true
//Explanation: The robot is initially at (0, 0) facing the north direction.
//"G": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: North.
//"G": move one step. Position: (0, 2). Direction: North.
//"L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 2). Direction: West.
//"L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 2). Direction: South.
//"G": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: South.
//"G": move one step. Position: (0, 0). Direction: South.
//Repeating the instructions, the robot goes into the cycle: (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 2) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 0).
//Based on that, we return true.
//Example 2:
//Input: instructions = "GG"
//Output: false
//Explanation: The robot is initially at (0, 0) facing the north direction.
//"G": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: North.
//"G": move one step. Position: (0, 2). Direction: North.
//Repeating the instructions, keeps advancing in the north direction and does not go into cycles.
//Based on that, we return false.
//Example 3:
//Input: instructions = "GL"
//Output: true
//Explanation: The robot is initially at (0, 0) facing the north direction.
//"G": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: North.
//"L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 1). Direction: West.
//"G": move one step. Position: (-1, 1). Direction: West.
//"L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (-1, 1). Direction: South.
//"G": move one step. Position: (-1, 0). Direction: South.
//"L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (-1, 0). Direction: East.
//"G": move one step. Position: (0, 0). Direction: East.
//"L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 0). Direction: North.
//Repeating the instructions, the robot goes into the cycle: (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (-1, 1) --> (-1, 0) --> (0, 0).
//Based on that, we return true.
// 
//Constraints:
//	1 <= instructions.length <= 100
//	instructions[i] is 'G', 'L' or, 'R'.
