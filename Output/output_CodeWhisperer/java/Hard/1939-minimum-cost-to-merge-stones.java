/**https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-merge-stones/ */
//There are n piles of stones arranged in a row. The ith pile has stones[i] stones.
//A move consists of merging exactly k consecutive piles into one pile, and the cost of this move is equal to the total number of stones in these k piles.
//Return the minimum cost to merge all piles of stones into one pile. If it is impossible, return -1.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: stones = [3,2,4,1], k = 2
//Output: 20
//Explanation: We start with [3, 2, 4, 1].
//We merge [3, 2] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 4, 1].
//We merge [4, 1] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 5].
//We merge [5, 5] for a cost of 10, and we are left with [10].
//The total cost was 20, and this is the minimum possible.
//Example 2:
//Input: stones = [3,2,4,1], k = 3
//Output: -1
//Explanation: After any merge operation, there are 2 piles left, and we can't merge anymore.  So the task is impossible.
//Example 3:
//Input: stones = [3,5,1,2,6], k = 3
//Output: 25
//Explanation: We start with [3, 5, 1, 2, 6].
//We merge [5, 1, 2] for a cost of 8, and we are left with [3, 8, 6].
//We merge [3, 8, 6] for a cost of 17, and we are left with [17].
//The total cost was 25, and this is the minimum possible.
// 
//Constraints:
//	n == stones.length
//	1 <= n <= 30
//	1 <= stones[i] <= 100
//	2 <= k <= 30
