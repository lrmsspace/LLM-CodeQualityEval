/**https://leetcode.com/problems/path-crossing/ */
//Given a string path, where path[i] = 'N', 'S', 'E' or 'W', each representing moving one unit north, south, east, or west, respectively. You start at the origin (0, 0) on a 2D plane and walk on the path specified by path.
//Return true if the path crosses itself at any point, that is, if at any time you are on a location you have previously visited. Return false otherwise.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: path = "NES"
//Output: false 
//Explanation: Notice that the path doesn't cross any point more than once.
//Example 2:
//Input: path = "NESWW"
//Output: true
//Explanation: Notice that the path visits the origin twice.
// 
//Constraints:
//	1 <= path.length <= 104
//	path[i] is either 'N', 'S', 'E', or 'W'.
