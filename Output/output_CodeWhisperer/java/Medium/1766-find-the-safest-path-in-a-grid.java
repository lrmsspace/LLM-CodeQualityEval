/**https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-safest-path-in-a-grid/ */
//You are given a 0-indexed 2D matrix grid of size n x n, where (r, c) represents:
//	A cell containing a thief if grid[r][c] = 1
//	An empty cell if grid[r][c] = 0
//You are initially positioned at cell (0, 0). In one move, you can move to any adjacent cell in the grid, including cells containing thieves.
//The safeness factor of a path on the grid is defined as the minimum manhattan distance from any cell in the path to any thief in the grid.
//Return the maximum safeness factor of all paths leading to cell (n - 1, n - 1).
//An adjacent cell of cell (r, c), is one of the cells (r, c + 1), (r, c - 1), (r + 1, c) and (r - 1, c) if it exists.
//The Manhattan distance between two cells (a, b) and (x, y) is equal to |a - x| + |b - y|, where |val| denotes the absolute value of val.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: grid = [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,1]]
//Output: 0
//Explanation: All paths from (0, 0) to (n - 1, n - 1) go through the thieves in cells (0, 0) and (n - 1, n - 1).
//Example 2:
//Input: grid = [[0,0,1],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
//Output: 2
//Explanation: The path depicted in the picture above has a safeness factor of 2 since:
//- The closest cell of the path to the thief at cell (0, 2) is cell (0, 0). The distance between them is | 0 - 0 | + | 0 - 2 | = 2.
//It can be shown that there are no other paths with a higher safeness factor.
//Example 3:
//Input: grid = [[0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0]]
//Output: 2
//Explanation: The path depicted in the picture above has a safeness factor of 2 since:
//- The closest cell of the path to the thief at cell (0, 3) is cell (1, 2). The distance between them is | 0 - 1 | + | 3 - 2 | = 2.
//- The closest cell of the path to the thief at cell (3, 0) is cell (3, 2). The distance between them is | 3 - 3 | + | 0 - 2 | = 2.
//It can be shown that there are no other paths with a higher safeness factor.
// 
//Constraints:
//	1 <= grid.length == n <= 400
//	grid[i].length == n
//	grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
//	There is at least one thief in the grid.
