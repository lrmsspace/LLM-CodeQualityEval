/**https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-non-overlapping-palindrome-substrings/ */
//You are given a string s and a positive integer k.
//Select a set of non-overlapping substrings from the string s that satisfy the following conditions:
//	The length of each substring is at least k.
//	Each substring is a palindrome.
//Return the maximum number of substrings in an optimal selection.
//A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: s = "abaccdbbd", k = 3
//Output: 2
//Explanation: We can select the substrings underlined in s = "abaccdbbd". Both "aba" and "dbbd" are palindromes and have a length of at least k = 3.
//It can be shown that we cannot find a selection with more than two valid substrings.
//Example 2:
//Input: s = "adbcda", k = 2
//Output: 0
//Explanation: There is no palindrome substring of length at least 2 in the string.
// 
//Constraints:
//	1 <= k <= s.length <= 2000
//	s consists of lowercase English letters.
