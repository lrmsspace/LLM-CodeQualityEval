/*
 You are given three integers m, n, and k.
 There is a rectangular grid of size m × n containing k identical pieces. Return the sum of Manhattan distances between every pair of pieces over all valid arrangements of pieces.
 A valid arrangement is a placement of all k pieces on the grid with at most one piece per cell.
 Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 The Manhattan Distance between two cells (xi, yi) and (xj, yj) is |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|.
 Example 1:
 Input: m = 2, n = 2, k = 2
 Output: 8
 Explanation:
 The valid arrangements of pieces on the board are:
 In the first 4 arrangements, the Manhattan distance between the two pieces is 1.
 In the last 2 arrangements, the Manhattan distance between the two pieces is 2.
 Thus, the total Manhattan distance across all valid arrangements is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 8.
 Example 2:
 Input: m = 1, n = 4, k = 3
 Output: 20
 Explanation:
 The valid arrangements of pieces on the board are:
 The first and last arrangements have a total Manhattan distance of 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.
 The middle two arrangements have a total Manhattan distance of 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
 The total Manhattan distance between all pairs of pieces across all arrangements is 4 + 6 + 6 + 4 = 20.
 Constraints:
 1 <= m, n <= 105
 2 <= m * n <= 105
 2 <= k <= m * n
