/**https://leetcode.com/problems/find-mode-in-binary-search-tree/ */
//Given the root of a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, return all the mode(s) (i.e., the most frequently occurred element) in it.
//If the tree has more than one mode, return them in any order.
//Assume a BST is defined as follows:
//	The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
//	The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
//	Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: root = [1,null,2,2]
//Output: [2]
//Example 2:
//Input: root = [0]
//Output: [0]
// 
//Constraints:
//	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
//	-105 <= Node.val <= 105
// 
//Follow up: Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).
