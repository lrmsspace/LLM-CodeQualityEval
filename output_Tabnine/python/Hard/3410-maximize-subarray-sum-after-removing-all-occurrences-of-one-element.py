# You are given an integer array nums.
# You can do the following operation on the array at most once:
# Choose any integer x such that nums remains non-empty on removing all occurrences of x.
# RemoveÂ all occurrences of x from the array.
# Return the maximum subarray sum across all possible resulting arrays.
# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [-3,2,-2,-1,3,-2,3]
# Output: 7
# Explanation:
# We can have the following arrays after at most one operation:
# The original array is nums = [-3, 2, -2, -1, 3, -2, 3]. The maximum subarray sum is 3 + (-2) + 3 = 4.
# Deleting all occurences of x = -3 results in nums = [2, -2, -1, 3, -2, 3]. The maximum subarray sum is 3 + (-2) + 3 = 4.
# Deleting all occurences of x = -2 results in nums = [-3, 2, -1, 3, 3]. The maximum subarray sum is 2 + (-1) + 3 + 3 = 7.
# Deleting all occurences of x = -1 results in nums = [-3, 2, -2, 3, -2, 3]. The maximum subarray sum is 3 + (-2) + 3 = 4.
# Deleting all occurences of x = 3 results in nums = [-3, 2, -2, -1, -2]. The maximum subarray sum is 2.
# The output is max(4, 4, 7, 4, 2) = 7.
# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
# Output: 10
# Explanation:
# It is optimal to not perform any operations.
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 105
# -106 <= nums[i] <= 106
