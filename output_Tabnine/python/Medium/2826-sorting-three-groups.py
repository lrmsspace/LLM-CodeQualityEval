# You are given an integer array nums. Each element in nums is 1, 2 or 3. In each operation, you can remove an element fromÂ nums. Return the minimum number of operations to make nums non-decreasing.
# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [2,1,3,2,1]
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# One of the optimal solutions is to remove nums[0], nums[2] and nums[3].
# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [1,3,2,1,3,3]
# Output: 2
# Explanation:
# One of the optimal solutions is to remove nums[1] and nums[2].
# Example 3:
# Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,3,3]
# Output: 0
# Explanation:
# nums is already non-decreasing.
# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 100
# 1 <= nums[i] <= 3
# Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in O(n) time complexity?
