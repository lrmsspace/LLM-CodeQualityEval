/**https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-score-of-a-path-between-two-cities/ */
//You are given a positive integer n representing n cities numbered from 1 to n. You are also given a 2D array roads where roads[i] = [ai, bi, distancei] indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities ai and bi with a distance equal to distancei. The cities graph is not necessarily connected.
//The score of a path between two cities is defined as the minimum distance of a road in this path.
//Return the minimum possible score of a path between cities 1 and n.
//Note:
//	A path is a sequence of roads between two cities.
//	It is allowed for a path to contain the same road multiple times, and you can visit cities 1 and n multiple times along the path.
//	The test cases are generated such that there is at least one path between 1 and n.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: n = 4, roads = [[1,2,9],[2,3,6],[2,4,5],[1,4,7]]
//Output: 5
//Explanation: The path from city 1 to 4 with the minimum score is: 1 -> 2 -> 4. The score of this path is min(9,5) = 5.
//It can be shown that no other path has less score.
//Example 2:
//Input: n = 4, roads = [[1,2,2],[1,3,4],[3,4,7]]
//Output: 2
//Explanation: The path from city 1 to 4 with the minimum score is: 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4. The score of this path is min(2,2,4,7) = 2.
// 
//Constraints:
//	2 <= n <= 105
//	1 <= roads.length <= 105
//	roads[i].length == 3
//	1 <= ai, bi <= n
//	ai != bi
//	1 <= distancei <= 104
//	There are no repeated edges.
//	There is at least one path between 1 and n.
