/**https://leetcode.com/problems/print-binary-tree/ */
//Given the root of a binary tree, construct a 0-indexed m x n string matrix res that represents a formatted layout of the tree. The formatted layout matrix should be constructed using the following rules:
//	The height of the tree is height and the number of rows m should be equal to height + 1.
//	The number of columns n should be equal to 2height+1 - 1.
//	Place the root node in the middle of the top row (more formally, at location res[0][(n-1)/2]).
//	For each node that has been placed in the matrix at position res[r][c], place its left child at res[r+1][c-2height-r-1] and its right child at res[r+1][c+2height-r-1].
//	Continue this process until all the nodes in the tree have been placed.
//	Any empty cells should contain the empty string "".
//Return the constructed matrix res.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: root = [1,2]
//Output: 
//[["","1",""],
// ["2","",""]]
//Example 2:
//Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4]
//Output: 
//[["","","","1","","",""],
// ["","2","","","","3",""],
// ["","","4","","","",""]]
// 
//Constraints:
//	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 210].
//	-99 <= Node.val <= 99
//	The depth of the tree will be in the range [1, 10].
