/**https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-the-length-of-two-palindromic-subsequences/ */
//Given a string s, find two disjoint palindromic subsequences of s such that the product of their lengths is maximized. The two subsequences are disjoint if they do not both pick a character at the same index.
//Return the maximum possible product of the lengths of the two palindromic subsequences.
//A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: s = "leetcodecom"
//Output: 9
//Explanation: An optimal solution is to choose "ete" for the 1st subsequence and "cdc" for the 2nd subsequence.
//The product of their lengths is: 3 * 3 = 9.
//Example 2:
//Input: s = "bb"
//Output: 1
//Explanation: An optimal solution is to choose "b" (the first character) for the 1st subsequence and "b" (the second character) for the 2nd subsequence.
//The product of their lengths is: 1 * 1 = 1.
//Example 3:
//Input: s = "accbcaxxcxx"
//Output: 25
//Explanation: An optimal solution is to choose "accca" for the 1st subsequence and "xxcxx" for the 2nd subsequence.
//The product of their lengths is: 5 * 5 = 25.
// 
//Constraints:
//	2 <= s.length <= 12
//	s consists of lowercase English letters only.
