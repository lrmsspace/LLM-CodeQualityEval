/**https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-vi/ */
//You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer k.
//You are initially standing at index 0. In one move, you can jump at most k steps forward without going outside the boundaries of the array. That is, you can jump from index i to any index in the range [i + 1, min(n - 1, i + k)] inclusive.
//You want to reach the last index of the array (index n - 1). Your score is the sum of all nums[j] for each index j you visited in the array.
//Return the maximum score you can get.
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: nums = [1,-1,-2,4,-7,3], k = 2
//Output: 7
//Explanation: You can choose your jumps forming the subsequence [1,-1,4,3] (underlined above). The sum is 7.
//Example 2:
//Input: nums = [10,-5,-2,4,0,3], k = 3
//Output: 17
//Explanation: You can choose your jumps forming the subsequence [10,4,3] (underlined above). The sum is 17.
//Example 3:
//Input: nums = [1,-5,-20,4,-1,3,-6,-3], k = 2
//Output: 0
// 
//Constraints:
//	1 <= nums.length, k <= 105
//	-104 <= nums[i] <= 104

 * @param {number} k
