/**https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/ */
//Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.
//You have the following three operations permitted on a word:
//	Insert a character
//	Delete a character
//	Replace a character
// 
//Example 1:
//Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
//Output: 3
//Explanation: 
//horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
//rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
//rose -> ros (remove 'e')
//Example 2:
//Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
//Output: 5
//Explanation: 
//intention -> inention (remove 't')
//inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
//enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
//exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
//exection -> execution (insert 'u')
// 
//Constraints:
//	0 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500
//	word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.
